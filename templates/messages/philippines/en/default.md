Hello @{{ mapper.displayName }}.

Kudos on joining OpenStreetMap(OSM) and making edits in the Philippines! You're definitely helping make the map better.

**OpenStreetMap Philippines** is an informal association of all OSM contributors in the country - mappers and users alike. To get in touch with fellow contributors, check out the [Philippine community channels](https://osm.org/wiki/PH) that's available in your platform. The group doesn't just only exist online, but also meet in real life, from time-to-time.

By the way, I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, and also an OSM contributor like you. Many like-minded folks support or guide fellow contributors in the Philippines, to answers questions or concerns they may have, and help make a better map for everyone. Here's some of our [projects](https://openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/Projects). 

If you've got any questions or concerns, we may be able to help you.  If you're unsure about how to map something, curious and would like to know more about OpenStreetMap or the local community, or simply want to touch bases with fellow contributors, you may try the following channels that are most active:

- **OSM Discourse Forum** - Check out [topics with the "Philippines" tag](https://community.openstreetmap.org/tag/philippines)
- **Telegram** - [OpenStreetMap Local Communities (LoCo) in the Philippines](https://t.me/OSMph)
- **Facebook** Facebook page - [OpenStreetMap Philippines](https://facebook.com/OSMPH)
- **Twitter** X(aka Twitter) - [#osmph](https://twitter.com/hashtag/osmph?f=live)

Here are a few tips to get you rolling:

- The editing tools in OSM make it easy to map things, and the [wiki](https://openstreetmap.org/wiki/)  provide details, alternative techniques, and related information about mapping features in OSM.
- If you want to know how to "tag" something, do the advanced search by inputing `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` (without the quotes) in your favourite search engine.
- When you save your changeset, add a concise but clear comment on what changes you've made. ([more info here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
- Make sure roads connect to each other, but don't connect them to landuse such as fields or residential areas, or make them cross each other without a common shared point.
- Get a glimpse of what's happening in global OSM communities,  subscribe to the [weekly newsletter of the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/).
- Keep track of your edits (or anybody else) with the [how did you contribute tool](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/)
- We compiled an [FAQ about data sources](https://osm.org/wiki/Philippines/FAQs_for_PH_data) that are relevant to contributors in the Philippines.
- Every third Wednesday of the month, we hold an online "[Map-py Wednesday](https://mobilizon.openstreetmap.fr/@mappy_wednesday)" event with lightning talks, and Q&A for mappers in Asia. A great opportunity to meet local neighbours, or make new friends across the region.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

On behalf of our OSM-PH community,
