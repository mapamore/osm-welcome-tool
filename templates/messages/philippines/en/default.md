Hello @{{ mapper.displayName }}

Kudos on making your first OpenStreetMap(OSM) edit in the Philippines! Thank you for your help making the map a little bit better.

**OpenStreetMap Philippines** is an informal association of all OSM contributors in the country - mappers and users alike. To get in touch with fellow contributors, check out the [Philippine community channels](https://osm.org/wiki/PH) in your platform.

By the way, I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, an OSM contributor like you. Many like-minded folks support fellow contributors in the Philippines, to share answers to questions or concerns they may have, and help make a better map for everyone.. Here's [some of our projects](https://openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/Projects). We don't only exist online, but also meet in real life, from time-to-time.

If you've got any questions or concerns, we may be able to help you: if you're unsure about how to map something, want to know more about OpenStreetMap, or simply want to touch based with fellow contributors, you may try the following channels that are most active:

- **OSM Discourse Forum** - Check out [topics with the "Philippines" tag](https://community.openstreetmap.org/tag/philippines)
- **Telegram** - [OpenStreetMap Local Communities (LoCo) in the Philippines](https://t.me/OSMph)
- **Facebook** Facebook page - [OpenStreetMap Philippines](https://facebook.com/OSMPH)
- **Twitter** X(aka Twitter) - [#osmph](https://twitter.com/hashtag/osmph?f=live)

Here are some tips to get you started:

- While the editing tools try to make it easy to find out how to map things, the [wiki pages](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/) will have details, and you can find more information about how to map in OSM. 
If you want to know how to tag something, the quickest way may be to search for `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` using your favourite search engine.
- When you save your changeset, add a concise but clear comment on what changes you've made. ([more info here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)).
- Make sure roads connect to each other, but don't connect them to landuse such as fields or residential areas, or make them cross each other without a common shared point.
- Get a glimpse of what's happening in global OSM communities,  subscribe to the [weekly newsletter of the OpenStreetMap world](https://weeklyosm.eu/).
- Keep track of your edits with the [how did you contribute tool](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/)
- We compiled an [FAQ about data sources](https://osm.org/wiki/Philippines/FAQs_for_PH_data) that are relevant to contributors in the Philippines

Have a Map-py Day, and we hope to hear from you in one of the above-mentioned channels.

On behalf of the OSM-PH community,
