Hello @{{ mapper.displayName }}.

Kudos on joining OpenStreetMap(OSM) and making edits in the Philippines! You're definitely helping make the map better.

**OpenStreetMap Philippines** is an informal association of all OSM contributors in the country - mappers and users alike. To get in touch with fellow contributors, check out the [Philippine community channels](https://osm.org/wiki/PH) that's available in your platform. The group doesn't just only exist online, but also meet in real life, from time-to-time.

By the way, I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, and also an OSM contributor like you. Many like-minded folks support or guide fellow contributors in the Philippines, to answers questions or concerns they may have, and help make a better map for everyone. Here's some of our [projects](https://openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/Projects). 

If you've got any questions or concerns, we may be able to help you.  If you're unsure about how to map something, curious and would like to know more about OpenStreetMap or the local community, or simply want to touch bases with fellow contributors, you may check out this [overview of resources](https://osm.org/wiki/User:GOwin/drafts/tips-for-newcomers) you can tap if you're mapping in the Philippines.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

On behalf of our OSM-PH community,

{{ app.user.displayName }}
